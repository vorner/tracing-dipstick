//! A bridge from [`tracing`]
//!
//! Traditionally, applications used separate instrumentation for metrics and logging. That is
//! tiresome to set up. Using [`tracing`] offers an opportunity to use single instrumentation and
//! export as both.
//!
//! This crate exports metrics through the [`dipstick`] metrics library, provided the
//! instrumentation uses specific attributes to events and spans. To use it:
//!
//! * Register the [`DipstickLayer`] to consume the spans and events.
//! * Use the `metrics.scope` on spans to create hierarchy of the metrics.
//! * Mark the spans and events with further `metrics.*` attributes to collect metrics of specific
//!   types and names.
//!
//! # Recognized attributes
//!
//! Whenever there's a span or event with one of these attributes, a metric is collected whenever
//! it is encountered. The value of the attribute is the name of the metric and the type (the thing
//! after the `metrics.`) corresponds to the metric types in [`dipstick`]'s [`InputScope`]. Spans
//! happen when they are created and some effects happen when they are closed/destroyed.
//!
//! * `metrics.counter="name"`: Adds 1 to the metric counter called `name`.
//! * `metrics.level="name"`: Adds 1 to the level called `name`. If it is present on a span, the 1
//!   is subtracted when it is closed (it's more useful on spans).
//! * `metrics.gauge="name"`: Sets the gauge to 1. This one is more useful in the second form
//!   below.
//! * `metrics.timer="name"`: Records the time between the creation of the span and its destruction.
//!   This attribute is accepted only on spans.
//! * `metrics.scope="scope-name"`: Names of metrics that are inside this span get prefixed by this
//!   name, eg. their names will be `scope-name.name`. Nested spans with this attributes accumulate
//!   the name, eg `outer-scope-name.inner-scope-name.name`. This is accepted on spans only.
//! * `metrics.scope.full="scope-name"`: Similar to the above, but the name is not nested, it is
//!   replaced.
//!
//! The `counter`, `level` and `gauge` accept alternative variant of `metrics.type.name=value` (for
//! example, `metrics.gauge.name=42`), which uses the given value instead of `1`.
//!
//! Unfortunately, typos don't cause compile errors, they are just ignored :-(.
//!
//! # Naming
//!
//! While the metrics are sent into the [`dipstick`] library, the attribute naming is quite
//! general. This is on purpose. The author envisions that other crates might offer similar
//! functionality, but export the metrics to a different library. In such case it is beneficial if
//! the attributes are the same â€’ in such case changing the "backend" means only different
//! initialization while the instrumentation of the whole code stays the same.
//!
//! # Crate status
//!
//! * There are some limitations about filtering (see the note at [`DipstickLayer`]). They may be
//!   fixed either in [`tracing_subscriber`] or by changes in here, but both needs some work.
//! * There are several performance inefficiencies that need to be eliminated.
//! * The crate has been tested only lightly and it's possible it might not act correctly in some
//!   corner cases.
//!
//! So, there's still some work to happen (and help in doing it is welcome). On the other hand, it
//! is unlikely to cause some _serious_ problems, only incorrect metric readings.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use std::thread;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! use dipstick::{AtomicBucket, ScheduleFlush, Stream};
//! use log::LevelFilter;
//! use tracing::{debug, info_span, subscriber};
//! use tracing_dipstick::DipstickLayer;
//! use tracing_subscriber::layer::SubscriberExt;
//! use tracing_subscriber::Registry;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     /*
//!      * We use the log-always integration of tracing here and route that to the env logger, that has
//!      * INFO enabled by default and can override by RUST_LOG to something else.
//!      *
//!      * We could use tracing_subscriber::fmt, *but* the EnvFilter there unfortunately disables
//!      * events/spans for the whole stack, not for logging only. And we want all the metrics while we
//!      * want only certain level of events.
//!      */

//!         .filter_level(LevelFilter::Info)

//!     root.drain(Stream::write_to_stdout());
//!     let _flush = root.flush_every(Duration::from_secs(5));
//!
//!     let bridge = DipstickLayer::new(root);
//!     let subscriber = Registry::default().with(bridge);
//!
//!     subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber).unwrap();
//!
//!     const CNT: usize = 10;
